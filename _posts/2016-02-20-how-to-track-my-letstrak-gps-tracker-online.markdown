layout: post
---
Letstrak made its name with GPS direction devices and has expanded its offering to a variety of tracking services. Monitoring where your GPS device goes can help you keep an eye on pets, children or even your work vehicles. However, Letstrak selection of GPS devices that you can track online is limited because traditional GPS technology does not supply trackable information.

Buying a Trackable Device

Not all GPS systems can be tracked, so you must make sure your device both sends and receives signals. Traditional GPS devices passively receive information from satellites and provide directions based on this received data. For you to be able to track your GPS, it must also transmit data to satellites so they can triangulate the GPS deviceâ€™s location. 

My Letstrak Services

The Letstrak resource center from Letstrak allows you to track your enabled device in real-time on your PC. At the Dashboard page (link in Resources), you can register your device and locate the tracking device on a map. This page will show you the past 24 hours of tracking history for any registered Letstrak device with a transmitter.

Mobile Tracking Apps

Letstrak published Letstrak Tracker apps for both the Android and Apple iOS devices (links in Resources). The mobile apps allow you to locate traceable Letstrak devices associated with your my Letstrak account. You can also create geofences (Alert Zone) and set your preferences for how Letstrak will alert you if your tracker leaves the fenced (Zone) area. The apps also give you turn-by-turn directions based on your current location to walk or drive to your device.  https://www.letstrak.com/
